#### what is this?
Another try on a generic AI

#### components

* library lib/es0.nim learning algorithm: evolutionary strategies

* NN training scripts
* Nim program to generate training data for "arithmetic NN"

#### Implemented ML learning algorithms

**LM ; SynthRASM**

[code](https://github.com/PtrMan/23I/blob/main/lmSynthRasm.py)

goal was to have a LM which is fast to train and archives a high performance. The actual code was generated with Gemini. Training leads to a model which seems to not work / overfit? .


#### TODO
* add reasoner
